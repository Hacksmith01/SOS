Resilient Futures: Real-time Disaster Alert and Relief Coordination Platform

Overview:

This project aims to develop a Real-time Disaster Alert and Relief Coordination Platform that provides disaster alerts (earthquakes, floods, hurricanes)
and enables relief coordination among local governments, NGOs, and volunteers. The platform integrates real-time data sources, facilitates aid distribution,
and leverages past disaster data for predictive analysis.

Features:

1.Real-time Disaster Alerts: Fetches and displays disaster notifications from multiple APIs (USGS, OpenWeatherMap, etc.).
2.Interactive Map: Uses Google Maps API or Leaflet.js to visualize disaster-affected areas.
3.Relief Coordination:Enables authorities and volunteers to track damage, request aid, and manage resources (food, medical supplies, shelter, etc.).
4.User Roles & Authentication: Differentiates between NGOs, government officials, and volunteers.

APIs & Data Sources:

Usage:

Users can sign up/log in based on their roles (NGO, Volunteer, Government Official).

Users can report damage and request aid, which is managed in the system.
Predictions (if enabled) help identify potential future disaster risks.

Future Improvements:

AI-driven damage assessment using satellite imagery.
Mobile app version for instant notifications.
Blockchain for transparent aid distribution tracking.
